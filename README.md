# Thoughtly_Mobile_beta
This is one of my academic projects for a mobile application called Thoughtly that can help people capture their precious thoughts.

Thoughtly was developed using Java for Android, MySQL database, and simple PHP scripts for the backend.

Thoughtly simply help people capture their thoughts by taking a picture of something that gave them the thought, and then using a recorder to add a recording quickly for this specific thought. After it is saved, the user can retrieve this thought and add his own comments on this thought and change the title of the thought.
